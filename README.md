# Transmitly.ChannelProvider.Firebase.FirebaseAdmin

A [Transmitly](https://github.com/transmitly/transmitly) channel provider dispatcher implementation using Google's [Firebase Admin .NET SDK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-dotnet).

### Getting started

If you're just starting out with Transmitly, you likely want to be using the [transmitly-channel-provider-firebase](https://github.com/transmitly/transmitly-channel-provider-firebase) package instead.

See the [Transmitly](https://github.com/transmitly/transmitly) project for more details on what a channel provider is and how it can be configured.
